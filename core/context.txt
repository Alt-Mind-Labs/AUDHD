21:50 on Apr 11, 2025

To implement login functionality with Facebook, Gmail, and email/password options, we need to connect to Supabase first. Supabase provides a secure authentication system that supports these methods.

Lovable has a native integration with Supabase that we recommend using for authentication. This integration can be set up by clicking on the green Supabase button on the top right of the interface and then connecting to Supabase.

Once the Supabase integration is activated, I can help you implement:

Email and password authentication
Social login with Facebook and Google
User profile management
Secure session handling
This approach is much more secure and reliable than attempting to build authentication from scratch on the frontend.

22:22 on Apr 11, 2025

Let me check if email authentication is properly set up in your application.

Looking at your current configuration, I notice that you have connected your Supabase project, but you haven't yet implemented the authentication functionality in your application code. The Supabase client is configured correctly in src/integrations/supabase/client.ts, but there's no authentication component or logic implemented.

To implement email authentication, we'll need to:

Create an authentication page
Implement sign-up and sign-in functionality
Add session management
Let me first set up the database tables for user profiles:



-- Create a profiles table to store additional user information
CREATE TABLE public.profiles (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  full_name TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);

-- Set up Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for users to view their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" 
ON public.profiles 
FOR SELECT 
USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Create policy for users to update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" 
ON public.profiles 
FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Create a trigger to create a profile when a new user signs up
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user() 
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email, full_name)
  VALUES (new.id, new.email, new.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name');
  RETURN new;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
Please review and approve these SQL commands that will create the necessary tables and security policies for user profiles.

Protected Routes: Added route protection for pages that require authentication.
Authentication Context: Created a global authentication context to manage user state throughout the app.
User Interface: Implemented a clean, user-friendly authentication page with tabs for sign-in and sign-up.
Header Updates: Modified the header to show user avatar and logout options when signed in.
To fully enable the social logins (Google and Facebook), you'll need to:

Go to the Supabase Dashboard -> Authentication -> Providers
Enable and configure Google and Facebook providers with your credentials
Make sure to add your site URL and redirect URLs in both Supabase and the social providers' developer consoles
Also, for testing purposes, you might want to disable email confirmation in the Supabase Authentication settings.

It looks like we encountered an error while running the SQL migration. The error is:

ERROR: 42704: type "vector" does not exist
LINE 41: ai_embeddings VECTOR(1536), -- for semantic search
This error occurs because we need to enable the pgvector extension before defining columns with the VECTOR type. Let's fix this and re-run the SQL script:

I've moved the CREATE EXTENSION statement to the beginning of the script to ensure the vector type is available before it's used. Please review and approve this updated SQL script.

I've implemented a system that scans and analyzes scientific research on ADHD and autism. The system includes a database to store research papers, techniques, and metadata, an edge function to fetch and process research data, and updated frontend components to display techniques based on the latest evidence.

Please use for check-in random questions from   https://adhduk.co.uk/adult-adhd-screening-survey/ and https://www.plymouthhospitals.nhs.uk/download.cfm?doc=docm93jijm4n7722.pdf&ver=23625 - please save these in a table

I'll create a system for check-in that uses random ADHD screening questions from the sources you provided. This will involve creating a database table and updating the assessment functionality.

Let's start by creating a database table to store these questions:



-- Create a table for ADHD screening questions
CREATE TABLE public.adhd_screening_questions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  question_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  source TEXT NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'ADHD UK', 'Plymouth NHS'
  category TEXT, -- Optional categorization like 'attention', 'hyperactivity', 'impulsivity'
  score_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'frequency', 'agreement', etc.
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);

-- Insert sample questions from ADHD UK
INSERT INTO public.adhd_screening_questions (question_text, source, category, score_type) VALUES
('How often do you have difficulty getting things in order when you have to do a task that requires organization?', 'ADHD UK', 'organization', 'frequency'),
('How often do you have problems remembering appointments or obligations?', 'ADHD UK', 'memory', 'frequency'),
('When you have a task that requires a lot of thought, how often do you avoid or delay getting started?', 'ADHD UK', 'procrastination', 'frequency'),
('How often do you fidget or squirm with your hands or feet when you have to sit down for a long time?', 'ADHD UK', 'hyperactivity', 'frequency'),
('How often do you feel overly active and compelled to do things, like you were driven by a motor?', 'ADHD UK', 'hyperactivity', 'frequency'),
('How often do you make careless mistakes when you have to work on a boring or difficult project?', 'ADHD UK', 'attention', 'frequency'),
('How often do you have difficulty keeping your attention when you are doing boring or repetitive work?', 'ADHD UK', 'attention', 'frequency'),
('How often do you have difficulty concentrating on what people say to you, even when they are speaking to you directly?', 'ADHD UK', 'attention', 'frequency'),
('How often do you misplace or have difficulty finding things at home or at work?', 'ADHD UK', 'organization', 'frequency'),
('How often are you distracted by activity or noise around you?', 'ADHD UK', 'distractibility', 'frequency');

-- Insert sample questions from Plymouth NHS
INSERT INTO public.adhd_screening_questions (question_text, source, category, score_type) VALUES
('I fail to give close attention to details or make careless mistakes in my work', 'Plymouth NHS', 'attention', 'agreement'),
('I have difficulty sustaining my attention in tasks or fun activities', 'Plymouth NHS', 'attention', 'agreement'),
('I find it difficult to concentrate on what people are saying to me', 'Plymouth NHS', 'attention', 'agreement'),
('I leave my seat in situations in which sitting is expected', 'Plymouth NHS', 'hyperactivity', 'agreement'),
('I feel restless or fidgety', 'Plymouth NHS', 'hyperactivity', 'agreement'),
('I talk excessively or feel internally that I am often "on the go"', 'Plymouth NHS', 'hyperactivity', 'agreement'),
('I blurt out answers before the questions have been completed', 'Plymouth NHS', 'impulsivity', 'agreement'),
('I have difficulty waiting my turn', 'Plymouth NHS', 'impulsivity', 'agreement'),
('I interrupt others or intrude in on others (e.g., butt into conversations or games)', 'Plymouth NHS', 'impulsivity', 'agreement'),
('I have difficulty wrapping up the final details of a project, once the challenging parts have been done', 'Plymouth NHS', 'executive_function', 'agreement'),
('I have trouble doing things in proper order or sequence', 'Plymouth NHS', 'executive_function', 'agreement'),
('I struggle to keep track of several different things at the same time', 'Plymouth NHS', 'executive_function', 'agreement');

-- Enable row level security
ALTER TABLE public.adhd_screening_questions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for read access
CREATE POLICY "Allow read access for all users" 
ON public.adhd_screening_questions FOR SELECT USING (true);
Please review and approve these SQL commands to create and populate the ADHD screening questions table. After that, I'll update the assessment functionality to use these questions.

The assessment system now uses random questions from our ADHD screening database. The key improvements include:

A function to fetch random questions from the database
Display of question source and category information
Different question types based on the score_type (frequency or agreement)
Loading state while questions are being fetched
Better error handling with fallback to sample questions if the database fetch fails
Scoring system that takes question categories into account
The assessment will now provide a more varied and professional experience using validated ADHD screening questions.

Refactor: Split TechniquePage into smaller components
View code
I've refactored the TechniquePage.tsx into several smaller, more focused components:

TechniqueHeader - Contains the header section with title and theme selector
TechniqueFilters - Contains the category filter buttons
TechniqueList - Handles displaying the list of techniques with loading/error states
ResearchProcess - Contains the accordion with research process information
useTechniques - Custom hook that contains all the data fetching logic
The refactored code maintains the exact same functionality as before, but is now more maintainable and follows better separation of concerns. Each component has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and modify in the future.

The changes are now complete! I've implemented dynamically generated insights text and created a system to store the history of a user's insights. The main changes include:

Updated the insightService.ts to generate dynamic insights with more varied text templates and save them to the new database table
Created a new InsightHistory component that displays previous insights in a collapsible format
Updated the ProfileInsights component to show both current insights and history
Ensured all dates are displayed in DD/MM/YYYY format
Now users can see how their insights evolve over time as they complete more assessments, with each insight stored in the database for future reference.
